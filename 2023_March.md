* Stable Diffusion  
Different with other diffusion model, stable diffusion diffuses latent codes to speed up the process.  
Another difference is that, during denoising process, stable diffusion introduces text information -> the NN model has two input, text's code (generated by CLIP) and latent code (generated by an Encoder).
